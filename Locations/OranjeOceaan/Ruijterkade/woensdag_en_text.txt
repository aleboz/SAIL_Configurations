Visit the BBQ at The Zonnebloem Boat. The Zonnebloem is a luxury Inland Cruise Vessel for chronically ill and disabled passengers. The vessel has been christened by Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands. The vessel is owned by a foundation "De Zonnebloem" who financed the vessel mainly by charity. The foundation provides chronically ill people and people in elderly homes the possibility to enjoy a cruising holyday with all necessary facilities on board. De Zonnebloem can sail throughout the European inland waterways but will mainly ply the Dutch inland waterways including the estuary in the south of Holland, the IJsselmeer and the Waddenzee..
