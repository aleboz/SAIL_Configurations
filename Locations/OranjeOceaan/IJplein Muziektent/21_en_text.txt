Maria de Fatima
In the 40 years of her career, Maria de Fátima has been singing a wide repertoire of traditional Fado, songs written by herself of especially for her, the so-called 'Fado canção' in the manner of Amália Rodrigues and Dulce Pontes, but also a repertoire beyond the context of Fado: no matter if she interpretes Jaques Brel, Diana Ross or Maria Bethania- from the moment Maria starts singing, everything is turned into Fado! According to herself, Fado is: “... A way to feel, a way to express yourself, short: a way of living.”
