SAIL Experience
SAIL Experience is the place to watch several demonstrative competitions like the Botter Experience and the Sk√ªtsje Experience. It is also the location of the review (with more than 150 ships!). From the tribune at the SAIL Experience (that is also accesible for disabled people) you have an excellent view at all the sailing events and at the fireworks.
