Saluut Protocollair

Location: Sixhaven - Orange Ocean

Event type: Culture, Nautic, Tall Ships, International

The traditional Saluut Protocollair during the SAIL-In is the custom of firing cannon salutes originated in the Royal Navy. When a cannon was fired, it partially disarmed the ship, so needlessly firing a cannon showed respect and trust. As a matter of courtesy a warship would fire her guns harmlessly out to sea, to show that she had no hostile intent.
